Question 2:

The third strategy is the best option. 

The first option is not ideal because it would cause every guest to gather around the door waiting for the room to open, with no way of knowing when that will be.

The second option is not efficient because while guest will not have to try to enter the room until it is available, they will still have to regularly check the sign to find out if it is available or busy.

With option three no guest should ever be trying to enter the room unless it is available, and none of the guests will ever have to worry about checking if the room is available: they will be directly notified when it is their turn to enter the room. 

This can best be implemented using the CLHLock Queue Lock discussed in the textbook and in class.
